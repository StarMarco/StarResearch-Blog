The goal here is not so much to repeat the information covered by so many others but instead to look at the VAE with the goal of introducing Dynamical Variational Autoencoders (DVAEs) later. Ultimately the aim is to cover how learn latent dynamics that describe the behaviour of complex systems. *Note, on the off chance someone is actually reading this (thank you for your interest) but this is my first blog post and so this content may change as I experiment with features and use this notebook as a prototype for future posts. So consider this a draft post for now]]></summary></entry></feed>
